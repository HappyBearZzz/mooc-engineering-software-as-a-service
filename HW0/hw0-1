While Pair Programming looks like a great experience, I went solo on this exercises. I'm new to Ruby and want to make sure I take time to digest the different control structures and methods that are part of the Ruby culture. The assignment was a great way to do that by forcing you to go through documentation on Array and Enumerable mainly (I didn't use Hashes for this exercises) and also some control structures.
